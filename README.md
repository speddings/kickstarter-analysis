## Overview of the Project ##
Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal.  Now we are analyzing kickstarter campaigns to compate how different campaigns faired in relathin to their launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges ##

## Results ##

- Conclusions drawn from ***Outcomes based on Launch Date***
  - The most successful theater campaings launch in May (111 out of 166) and June (100 out of 153) or 67%.
  - Theater campaigns that launch in the winter months of nov, dec, and Jan are the least successful.

- Conclusions drawn from the ***Outcomes based on Goals***
  - Campaigns with a lower goal, under 4999, are more likely to be successful.

- Limitations of this dataset
  - Outcomes based goals which uses percentage, does not account for total projects and could be misleading. For example, while the fail% for campaigns with a goal between between 40000-44999 would indicate this is not an ideal target, there is only one campaign.
