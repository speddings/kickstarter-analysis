## Results ##

- Conclusions drawn from ***Outcomes based on Launch Date***
  - based on launch month, May is the most successful for theater campaigns (111 out of 166) and June (100 out of 153) or 67%. This can be determined by reveiwing the high peak of the chart 
  - Theater campaigns that launch in the winter months of nov, dec, and Jan are the least successful.

- Conclusions drawn from the ***Outcomes based on Goals***
  - Campaigns with a goal in the range of 4,000-4,999, are more likely to be successful.

- Limitations of this dataset
  - Outcomes based goals which uses percentage, does not account for total projects and could be misleading. For example, while the fail% for campaigns with a goal between between 40000-44999 would indicate this is not an ideal target, there is only one campaign.
