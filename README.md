# An Analysys of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of the Project ##
Louise's play ***Fever*** came close to its fundraising goal.  Now we are analyzing kickstarter campaigns to compare how different campaigns faired in relation to their launch date and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges ##
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
More campaigns succeed than fail, no matter the launch date. May launched the most number of successful campaigns. This is indicated in the chart where the blue line (successful) is always higher than the orange line (failed).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with lower goal targets do better. 75% of campaigns with a target of less than $1000 were successful compared to campaigns with higher goals obetwen $15,000 - $25,000 or campaigns with goals ovcer $40,000.

## Results ##

- Conclusions drawn from ***Outcomes based on Launch Date***
  - based on launch month, May is the most successful for theater campaigns. 
  - Theater campaigns that launch in the winter months of Nov, Dec, and Jan are the less successful.

- Conclusions drawn from the ***Outcomes based on Goals***
  - Campaigns with a goal under $4,999, are more likely to be successful.

- Limitations of this dataset
  - there are only 4 campaings with goals between $40,000 and $49,999. this small sampling has the potential of skewing the calcuations.
  
- Other tables and/or graphs to look at the data
